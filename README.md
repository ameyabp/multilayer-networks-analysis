# Welcome to Project3

Project3 is a network analysis and data visualization tool intended for use with both single and multilayer networks.

## Running Our Program

First, navigate to the ```flask``` directory and run the command ```python p.py```. After this, navigate to the ```frontend``` directory and run ```npm run start```. After this, you should be able to view the program by navigating to ```https://localhost:3000/```.

Alternatively on Mac or Linux, you can run the command ```./start.sh``` in the root folder to start the program. BE SURE to exit the program with ```ctrl+c``` with this command or else they might be running in the background!

## Upcoming TODOS:

* Integrate Neo4j.
* Integrate querying support in browser.
* Implement support for general spreadsheet inputs as opposed to set data.
* Multilayer & streaming data support.
